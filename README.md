# Crypto Price Monitor Task

## Project Overview

The **Crypto Price Monitor Task** is designed to track real-time cryptocurrency prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum using the CoinGecko API. The task retrieves the latest prices and stores this data on the Koii Network, ensuring decentralized, continuous, and reliable access to up-to-date cryptocurrency prices. This project leverages the robustness of the Koii Network to provide a decentralized solution for cryptocurrency price monitoring.

## Problem Statement

Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and having access to accurate, real-time price data is crucial for traders, investors, and analysts. Centralized platforms often suffer from outages, delays, and single points of failure, which can impact decision-making processes. The Crypto Price Monitor Task addresses these issues by:

- Providing a decentralized, reliable source of real-time cryptocurrency prices.
- Ensuring data availability and integrity through the Koii Network.
- Reducing dependency on centralized systems that can be prone to failures and manipulations.

## Why This Project?

This project aims to provide a decentralized alternative for accessing cryptocurrency price data. By using the Koii Network, we can leverage a robust, distributed infrastructure to ensure data availability and integrity. This project demonstrates the potential of decentralized applications (dApps) in the field of financial data services, offering an innovative solution to common problems faced by users in the cryptocurrency market.

## Target Users

The Crypto Price Monitor Task is designed for:

- **Traders**: Individuals who buy and sell cryptocurrencies and require real-time price data to make informed decisions.
- **Investors**: People investing in cryptocurrencies who need accurate and timely price information to manage their portfolios.
